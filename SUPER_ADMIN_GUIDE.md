# Super Admin Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds role-based access control to the Kaffi Cafe POS system with Super Admin privileges.

## Super Admin Credentials (Hardcoded)
- **Username**: `superadmin`
- **PIN**: `9999`

## Features Added

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **Super Admin**: Full access to all screens including Inventory/Products and Staff Management
- **Staff**: Limited access - can only see Orders, Online Orders, Reservations, Reports, Transactions, and Settings

### 2. Restricted Screens
The following screens are only accessible to Super Admin:
- **Inventory/Products Screen** (`inventory_screen.dart`)
- **Staff Management Screen** (`staff_screen.dart`)

### 3. Navigation Changes
- **Drawer Widget**: Dynamically shows/hides restricted menu items based on user role
- **Direct Access Protection**: Prevents direct navigation to restricted screens

## How to Use

### Super Admin Login
1. Open the app
2. On the staff login screen, click **"Super Admin Login"**
3. Enter credentials:
   - Username: `superadmin`
   - PIN: `9999`
4. Click **"Login as Super Admin"**

### Staff Login
1. Use regular staff login process
2. Staff accounts will have limited access automatically

### Testing the Role System

#### Test 1: Super Admin Access
1. Login as Super Admin
2. Verify you can see all menu items in the drawer:
   - Orders
   - Online Orders
   - Reservations
   - Products (visible)
   - Reports
   - Transactions
   - Staff Management (visible)
   - Settings

#### Test 2: Staff Access
1. Login as regular staff
2. Verify restricted items are hidden:
   - Products menu item should be hidden
   - Staff Management menu item should be hidden

#### Test 3: Direct Access Prevention
1. Login as regular staff
2. Try to navigate directly to `/inventory` or `/staff`
3. Should be redirected to home screen

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`lib/utils/role_service.dart`** - New file for role management
2. **`lib/screens/staff_screen.dart`** - Added Super Admin login
3. **`lib/widgets/drawer_widget.dart`** - Dynamic menu based on role
4. **`lib/screens/inventory_screen.dart`** - Role check on access
5. **`lib/screens/staff_screen.dart`** - Role check on access (for management)

### Key Classes
- `RoleService`: Handles role checking and Super Admin validation
- `DrawerWidget`: Now stateful and checks user role
- Updated screens with role-based access control

## Security Notes
- Super Admin credentials are hardcoded and should be changed in production
- Regular staff cannot access restricted screens even with direct URLs
- Role information is stored in SharedPreferences

## Future Enhancements
- Add role management UI for Super Admin
- Support multiple admin levels
- Add audit logging for role changes
